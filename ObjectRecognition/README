1. Instructions to run:

a) Make sure you have set your MATLAB path to ObjectRecognition folder
   which contains all the scripts.

b) Replace path to VLFEAT root directory in matchComparison.m and 
   detectObject.m with your path for VLFEAT

c) Set object template and scene names in both the scripts.

d) Run matchComparison or detectObject from command window :D

NOTE:

- We have provided some flags for disabling intermediate results if you are
interested only in final figures. You can set these to false.
